<h1>Mother Teresa</h1>
  <section>
  <p>Anytime someone asks me who is inrpsing the first person that comes to mind is Mother Teresa. Mother Teresa is very well known for her humanitarian efforts. Mother Teresa was a catholic nun that founded Missionaries of Charity. She mainly worked with the poor and actually ended up winning a nobel peace prize for her humbleness in helping others. The one thing that is very inspiring to me is the fact that she helped thousands of people no matter their religion even though she was religious herself.
